The Pyramid helps us focus top-down to decide on our Core Goals then Develop them in different levels. A Pyramid also helps us learn, by extracting a book's Core Goal and Supporting Ideas, then read everything bottom-up as connected to the Goal.

Implementing Engineering projects takes several different Feedback Cycles at different levels. At the outer level we're implemented mulitiple Features to fit the client's Goals.
