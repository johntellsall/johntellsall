# John Tells All

I am an **accomplished**, **innovative** Backend Dev/DevOps Engineer, with skills in **Cloud** and **Security**

## Ideas

I blog at [dev.to/johntellsall](https://dev.to/johntellsall), mostly on "Fast Developer" and "Fast DevOps", but also Fast Startup. My focus is also on Quality but `fast` is what people search for :)  Twitter is [@johntellsall](https://twitter.com/johntellsall) Best intro video is [Fast DevOps Feedback with Terraform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7VlmClTDs)

My work in the last decade is mostly DevOps, and my strong Dev background leads to a unique viewpoint. Infra as Code is no problem -- DevOps tools can be rough, so adapting Developer Best Practices reduces risk, speeds up the feedback loop, and pays ROI _forever_.
