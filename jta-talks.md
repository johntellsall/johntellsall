# JohnTellsAll Talks

I've been obsessed with Dev, DevOps, and Quality for many years. Like my parents before me, I really enjoy working with and teaching other Engineers at all phases of the career path. In the Los Angeles area I've given dozens of talks and worshops, and helped lead a few Meetup groups.

## Core

- Platonic Solids of Quality
  - This is the gestation of my book: I realized a few extremely simple symbols can compress a lot of valuable, useful Engineering insight.

- Testing Pyramid and Consequences [2019]

I gave this at the "learn how to get a QA job" group Test Pro, where 99% of the audience knew of the Testing Pyramid. Later at the Socal Python group (mostly developers), I was shocked to see only ~30% of the devs had heard of it!
