# JohnTellsAll Talks

I've been obsessed with Dev, DevOps, and Quality for many years. Like my parents before me, I really enjoy working with and teaching other Engineers at all phases of the career path. In the Los Angeles area I've given dozens of talks and worshops, and helped lead a few Meetup groups.

## Upcoming

- Fast Dev/DevOps [soon]
  - The "Fast DevOps with Terraform" talk below is being expanded into the core of my book, which includes new talks: 
    - Fast Development (shim code, "test" first)
    - Fast Dev Workflows (change focus/latency to create sharp tools to create code)- Fast DevOps Workflows (same, with stateful Resources and eventually-consistent APIs)

- (short) Linux/Kubernetes Overlap [soon]
  - People are intimidated at all that YAML. I briefly show how K8s resources are Linux resources, so we can use traditiona tools to see and control them -- good old `ps` and `top` and `strace`

## Core

- Platonic Solids of Quality [2016]
  - This is the gestation of my book: I realized a few extremely simple symbols can compress a lot of practical Engineering insight.

I gave this talk twice. At the "learn how to get a QA job" group Test Pro, 99% of the audience knew the Testing Pyramid. Later at the Socal Python group (mostly developers), I was shocked to see only ~30% of the devs had heard of it!
