# Project Management Triangle

## Why

The Project Management (PM) Triangle is a classic tool which helps to focus business energy productively. It's useful to use as an Engineer (Dev or DevOps), a Team Lead, or as a Business Stakeholder using Engineering services. It's also  critical for consultants.

Businesses always want everything now, ready to be deployed, and free*.

The PM Triangle says that businesses must make tradeoffs. Projects will deliver two out of three of these aspects: Time, Cost, and Scope. The other aspect will suffer. The Triangle also says that Quality is affected by any change in Time-Cost-Scope.


> This is literal. When I did enterprise consulting every single client asked for production-ready web-scale solutions "now". They'd laugh, but also look at us consultants expectantly.

## XX What

The PM Triangle has four parts:

It can be restated as:

> "Good, fast, cheap. Choose two."


## Why this is useful

As Engineers, we deal with reality, even when computers are involved. By focusing on the PM Triangle and explaining it to our clients, we can help focus everyone's efforts productively.

## Strategies

- choose priorities, then document and explain them
- given the priorities, set expectations, and 
- discuss priorities with workers and management often: weekly or monthly
- review and update: monthly or quarterly

As a Developer, it's easy to get off track. Often multiple projects will be going "full steam ahead" but then fail to converge on at the same destination, which causes confusion and delay. Technical Team Leads need to set and manage expectations, and reinforce often. This happens both down (to the Developers) and up (to the Business stakeholders).

## Conclusion


Businesses always want everything now (Time), the whole project (Scope), ready to be deployed (Quality), and free (Cost). By using the PM Triangle, and clearly managing priorities and expectations, business energy will go towards delivering the right products at the right time.
